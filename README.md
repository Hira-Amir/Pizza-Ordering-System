# Pizza-Ordering-System
This was my first semester project. Pizza ordering system created using C++ programming language. I have used object oriented concepts, 
it allows user to place an order according to the menu . Menu contains different types of pizza, with this user can also select size, quantity and delivery time 
and finally the bill will be shown to the user.
